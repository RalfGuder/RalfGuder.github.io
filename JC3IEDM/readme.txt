
Congratulations on gaining a copy of the JC3IEDM Data Model Browsing Tool!



USAGE NOTES:

To run the tool, simply double-click the file named 'index'.

When first entering either 'entity list', 'attribute list' or 'domain list', you may see an 
MS Internet Explorer security warning of an active content.  Allowing the active content
will provide an index to rapidly navigate the alphabetical lists.

The use of the 'back to:' links for entity, attribute or domain lists will return users to 
the TOP of the respective list.  Alternatively, the use of the browser’s 'Back' button will
return users to the DEPARTURE POINT within the list.

In the entity list, the use of bold is to indicate independent entities.
